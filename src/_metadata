All it does is fiddle with the Isotopes branch of the Geology research tree and moves it over to the left.\n\nI made this mod to support this mod:\n[list]\n  [*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2891773441]mORE Liquids/Frackin' Universe Patch[/url]\n[/list]\n\nThis mod does the following:\n[list]\n [*] Moves the isotopes branch of the geology tree off to the left a bit to un-bunch the research tree\n [*] Visualizes the existing fact that uranium and plutonium are both branches off of survival; Moves them to be siblings visibly.\n [*] Makes encriched isotopes a child of both plutonium and uranium, since they are both research unlockables\n[/list]\n\n\n\nBoring Stuff:\n[url=https://github.com/BardezAnAvatar/Starbound-bardez-frackin-research-geology-isotopes-moved]Source on GitHub[/url]",
