# Starbound-bardez-frackin-research-geology-isotopes-moved

This repo is a mod for [Starbound](https://playstarbound.com/), based on top of the following mods:
- [Frackin' Universe](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149)

This mod does the following:
- [X] Moves the isotopes branch of the geology tree off to the left a bit to un-bunch the research tree
- [X] Visualizes the existing fact that uranium and plutonium are both branches off of survival; Moves them to be siblings visibly.
- [X] Makes encriched isotopes a child of both plutonium and uranium, since they are both research unlockables

NOTES: As a statement of intent or criticism or something: Uranium should be first, followed by plutonium, followed by Neptunium and Thorium.
It drives me nuts that plutonium is unlocked before uranium.
